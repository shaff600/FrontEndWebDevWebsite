        <h1>Training Advice</h1>

        <p>In order to get the most out of your training, you must follow some basic simple training principles which are overload, specificity, reversibility, and variance. This dedicated blog page would be updated on a weekly basis, providing you with all the training principles you need to make gains!</p>

        <h1>Training Principles</h1>

        <button type="button" class="dropdown"> Pyramiding </button> <!-- button spanning the width of the screen top create dropdown effect when selected -->
        <div class="content"> <!-- div element for dropdown text to go inside -->
          <p>Every set performed in this split/routine is pyramided up, this basically means when you start your working sets of 6-8 or 8-10 for example the first two sets your just building up the reps and not hitting failure, I repeat you do not hit and form of muscular failure on these sets, it’s important you save the energy for the last set and go all out doing whatever you can to hit that rep range. Of course before these exercises make sure the muscle is 100% warmed up and primed to lift the weight.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="dropdown"> Super-Set </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>A super set comprises of two exercises back to back without any rest, on these sets you will want to pyramid up and hit failure, if possible hit failure on the last two sets of every exercise.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="dropdown"> Giant Set </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>A giant set comprises of 3 to 4 exercises all done in succession , you may take 10-15 seconds between moving between exercises and rest 2-3 minutes between each giant set. Again increment weight each set until you fail at the designated rep scheme. With giant sets you will find increment of weight is minimal due to the volume of the overall set.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="dropdown"> Rest Periods </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Now during your heavy compounds as well as hypertrophy we still want to perform maximal effort during these sets so it’s silly to have a 70 sec rest in between an all-out 8-12 rep max bench for example so I strongly advise taking around 2 minutes in between compound exercises so each set you can give it your all, but still make sure you keep the muscle warm in between this rest period. However in between sets/rounds of supersets take a small break of maximum 60 seconds.</p>
        </div>

        <button type="button" class="dropdown"> Progressive Overload </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Now it’s essential for your muscle growth that you aim to get stronger week by week, whether it be by reps or weight, you should fully try and aim to get stronger.</p>
